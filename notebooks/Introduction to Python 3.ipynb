    "* is interpreted\n",
    " * interpreters exist for most platforms\n",
    "* is multi-paradigm (incl. object-oriented)\n",

    "### Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2 of the Python language (2.7 is the current minor version) is what made Python popular. However it was far from perfect, and version 3 of Python fixes many of the most glaring design flaws in Python 2.\n",

    "   * most common data communications protocols (HTTP and email protocols)\n",
    "   * more data types, programming libraries\n",
    "* the Python ecosystem, mostly available via the [Python Package Index PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)\n",
