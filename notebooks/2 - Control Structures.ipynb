    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if variable > 5:\n",
    "  do_something()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to languages like C, Java or Lisp, do you feel something is missing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is whitespace-aware and it uses the so-called [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule) to annotate **code blocks**. This has several benefits\n",
    "* It's easy to read at a glance\n",
    "* levels of indentation are processed [pre-attentively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-attentive_processing) to conserve brain power for everything\n",
    "* It's easy to write without having to worry too much\n",
    "\n",
    "One corollary of the indentation is that you need to be very aware of when you're using the tabulator character and when you're using a space. Most Python programmers only use whitespace and configure their editor to output several spaces when tab is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: the line before a deeper level of indentation ends in a colon \":\". This syntax is part of beginning a new code block and surprisingly easy to forget."
